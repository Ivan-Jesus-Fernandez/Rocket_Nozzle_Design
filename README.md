# Rocket_Nozzle_Design
- Custom designs of a rocket engine nozzle in MATLAB<br>
The attached code designs a custom rocket engine nozzle in the programming language (MATLAB) and creates a CAD model of it in SolidWorks.(or any other CAD software via Excel data points obtained)

## About
- This MATLAB code can be used as a means to design, build, and potentially test a custom rocket engine. 
- Further, one can then import this nozzle into ANSYS to perform computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.
- The algorithm utilized is the Method of Characteristics (MoC) which is a very popular tool in designing rocket engines. 
- MoC is used by academics as well as industry professionals to design rocket engine nozzles for optimum rocket flight performances.

## Concepts utilized in the attached MATLAB code:
- Compressible Flow Basics (Over Expanded, Under Expanded, Shock Waves, Isentropic Flow).
- MATLAB Fundamentals (For Loops, If / Else Statements, Importing data from Excel using xlsread).
- Method of Characteristics Algorithm (Mach Angle, Expansion Fans, Prandtl-Meyer Function).
- Exporting Excel data points to SolidWorks.
- Designing the 3D CAD model of the Nozzle.
- SolidWorks Fundamentals (Sketching, Offset, Loft, Importing csv files).
